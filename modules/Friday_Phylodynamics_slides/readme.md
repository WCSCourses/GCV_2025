# Welcome To Friday Phylodynamics

There are 3 sets of slides in pdf format:
<ul>
<li>Phylo1-Phylodynamics_General_no_movie.pdf
<li>Phylo2-Time-Scale_and_Tempest.pdf
<li>Phylo3-Time-Scale_and_BEAST.pdf
</ul>

The data you will need for this part is within the course_data folder

## Activities

A. Try Tempest software using the exemplar newick trees, instructions are in Phylo2-Time-Scale_and_Tempest.pdf and example trees are in the Tempest_files folder.

B. Try the BEAST 1 practical with discrete traits on SARS-CoV-2 data - the general theory is in Phylo3-Time-Scale_and_BEAST.pdf, and the instructions are in Phylodynamics and Phylogeography Practical Handout - SARS-CoV-2 discrete.pdf

C. Optional - Try now adding latitude and longitude continuous traits and visualising the trees on a map using R.  See phylodynamics_Rcode folder, and the R-markdown/html.  The command line R code, along with list R packages and custom functions can be found in Mcc_tree_plot_example.R.  Also included is a discrete traits + latlon continuous traits mcc tree from the SARS-CoV-2 data set.

D. Optional - Try the alternative BEAST 1 practical with AIV - the first part of this is the same as B but it goes on to Google Earth Visualisation; see the AIV_example_files subfolder within the course_data for details.
